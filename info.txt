This is an very easy to use Ping-tester!
It will only work on Windows 10 or Windows 8.
By clicking on the file and running it the programm 
will send packages to 1.1.1.1 so you can see the ping.
The delay/Ping is locatet to the middle of the screen (CMD).



Hope you like it. ItÂ´s my first real project!
